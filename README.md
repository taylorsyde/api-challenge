# Python API Homework - What's the Weather Like?

## Part I - WeatherPy

This Python script creates visualizations of the weather in 500+ cities across the world. To accomplish this, I utilizied a [simple Python library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/citipy) and [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api).

My vizulizations include:

* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude


## Part II - VacationPy

This python scipt creates a heatmap of the current humidity in 500+ cities. In addition, this scpirt find hotels all around the world that currently have my ideal weather conditions.
